*The idea of our final project is to make traditional museums more interesting for adolescents and young adults of age 16 to 20 years by using popular contemporary means. The process was relatively simple as we are about the same age and live in times of great usage of smartphones and different advanced technologies. One of the most widely practiced mobile applications today is TikTok. It is a platform for short-form videos which might include jokes, dances, pranks as well as very informative descriptions or stories. Usually the length of the videos varies between 15 seconds and 10 minutes in order to hold the attention of the user. That is why we decided to use this principle: it is difficult for teenagers to concentrate on something for too long or read a long text. Instead, we suggest making a video description of every object. 
In addition to it, creating the animation of the object in 3D would be a great feature. The visitor will have an opportunity to change the size of it, to turn or zoom in/out to look at the details on the screen. Furthermore, touch is a very important sensor humans have which helps to explore the surroundings and remember things. So, to make the visit more interactive, we propose creating a copy of the object itself. A duplicate of the object can be created with 3D printing which the person will be able to touch. Unfortunately in an old school museum, you are not allowed to touch anything for the sake of saving the objects. However,  if we create and showcase the duplicate which looks and feels as close to the original as possible, the experience in the museum will be completely different. 
Taking all these things into consideration, we combined the ideas to form a concept of quest rooms which are described below.
