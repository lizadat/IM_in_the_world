* Idea: 
The idea of our final project is to make traditional museums more interesting for adolescents and young adults of age 16 to 20 years by using popular contemporary means. The process was relatively simple as we are about the same age and live in times of great usage of smartphones and different advanced technologies. One of the most widely practiced mobile applications today is TikTok. It is a platform for short-form videos which might include jokes, dances, pranks as well as very informative descriptions or stories. Usually the length of the videos varies between 15 seconds and 10 minutes in order to hold the attention of the user. That is why we decided to use this principle: it is difficult for teenagers to concentrate on something for too long or read a long text. Instead, we suggest making a video description of every object. 
In addition to it, creating the animation of the object in 3D would be a great feature. The visitor will have an opportunity to change the size of it, to turn or zoom in/out to look at the details on the screen. Furthermore, touch is a very important sensor humans have which helps to explore the surroundings and remember things. So, to make the visit more interactive, we propose creating a copy of the object itself. A duplicate of the object can be created with 3D printing which the person will be able to touch. Unfortunately in an old school museum, you are not allowed to touch anything for the sake of saving the objects. However,  if we create and showcase the duplicate which looks and feels as close to the original as possible, the experience in the museum will be completely different. 
Taking all these things into consideration, we combined the ideas to form a concept of quest rooms which are described below.

* Concept: 
One of the most exciting things people between the ages of 16-20 like to do is to go on a quest. The Quest Room concept seeks to transform the museum space into an exciting new adventure which combines the knowledge of selected museum  artifacts with interesting puzzles and questions, and animation to sustain the visitorâ€™s interest and attention. The questions and puzzles will form a thread which will lead to an amazing discovery at the end of the tour. Because rewarding systems are known to increase user performance, points will be awarded to encourage the persistent involvement of the visitors to the artifacts presented to them. 
The flow of the museum: the visitor enters the first room. There he/she sees an exhibit object, screen that has an animated picture of the object, which the user can use (zoom in/out, turn etc) in order to get to know about it, the hologram which plays the informative video about it (15 sec to 10 mins) and the duplicate of the object. As soon as the visitor has experienced everything, he presses the button DONE on the screen and later on the question appears (or the question might be asked between the rooms as shown in the sketch). When the visitor answers the question (it will start with the general and continues with harder questions which are related to what was just discovered by the visitor) he/she will be allowed to enter the next room.

* Suggestions: 
As the person goes through all the objects in the museum and listens to the stories and interacts with them, the time might go very quickly and he/she will be tired of the visit. In order to make it more pleasant we would recommend limiting the amount of the objects to 15. If in every room the person spends at least 5 minutes he/she will not feel exhausted in the end. 
No doubt, there should be an option of choosing the language for a particular visitor. 
As the museum is divided into parts and mostly the rooms are assigned for 1 user at a time, it might be hard for the school groups to come. Our idea is that these groups can be divided into subgroups (2-3 people) and go through the museum together group by group room by room.
